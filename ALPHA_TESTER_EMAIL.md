# Alpha Tester Email - Did-It v1.0.3-alpha

**Subject: Did-It v1.0.3-alpha is Live! üöÄ Your Feedback Made This Happen**

---

Hi everyone,

I'm honestly blown away by the feedback you've all sent in for "Did-It" so far. Thank you so, so much. I've read every single comment, and it's been the driving force behind this huge new update.

I'm super excited to let you know that **Version 1.0.3-alpha** is now ready for you to try!

A ton of work went into this one. I've squashed a lot of the annoying bugs you found and, thanks to your ideas, I've built in some powerful new features that I really hope you'll love.

Here's a little taste of what you helped me build:

**üé® Enhanced UI Animations & Smoothness** - Completely overhauled all animations to be fluid, modern, and easy on the eyes with proper timing and interpolators.

**üåô Fixed Dark Mode Calendar** - The reminder calendar now properly displays visible dates in dark mode instead of the white-on-white nightmare it was before.

**üìù Red-Bordered Notes Input** - Added a beautiful red border to the notes text box that matches the app's theme, with a subtle faint border when not selected and a prominent red border when focused.

**‚ö° Performance Optimizations** - Squashed the jarring task box expansion animations and made the entire app feel buttery smooth with proper UI refresh handling.

**üîß Data Safety & Migration** - Implemented bulletproof data persistence so your existing tasks will never be lost during updates (this was a big one based on your feedback!).

**üéØ Theme Consistency** - Fixed all the theme inconsistencies you spotted, ensuring the red accent color is used consistently throughout the app.

**üì± Play Store Ready** - Optimized the entire app for Play Store release with proper ProGuard rules, performance enhancements, and security improvements.

How to get it:
You should be able to update the app directly from the Google Play Store. Once you've had a chance to play around with the new stuff, I'd be so grateful if you could drop your thoughts in the feedback form.
